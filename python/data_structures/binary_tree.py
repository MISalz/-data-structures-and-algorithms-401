    Create a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
pre order
in order
post order which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors.
For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom,
    semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.
