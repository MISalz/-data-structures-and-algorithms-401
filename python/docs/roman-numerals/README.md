# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Read Turning Ideas Into Code (Links to an external site.) blog post.

Name your files "roman_numerals.py" and "test_roman_numerals.py."
Place them in appropriate locations.

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

**worked with Ella on this code challenge**


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->

run pytest

tests show that even when passing a lowercase letter it will still calculate the totals.
