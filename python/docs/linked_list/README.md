# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

**Node**

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

**Linked List**

-Create a Linked List class<br>
-Within your Linked List class, include a head property.<br>
-Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.<br>

-Any exceptions or errors that come from your code should be semantic, capture-able errors.<br>
-For example, rather than a default error thrown by your language, your code should raise/throw a custom, semantic error that describes what went wrong in calling the methods you wrote for this lab.<br>
-Be sure to follow your language/frameworks standard naming conventions (e.g. C# uses PascalCasing for all method and class names).<br>
