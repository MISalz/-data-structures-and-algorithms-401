## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I worked with Ella and Katrina and we got some similar but different code.
I was given a reference of https://www.educative.io/edpresso/the-valid-parentheses-problem for the solution. I didnt really understand the stack so it was helpful to have solution code and help from my teamMates.


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
pytest -k  test_stack_queue_brackets
