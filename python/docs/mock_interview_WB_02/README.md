Code Challenge 09 - Mock interview
Interviewer Nicolas Mercado

# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Ask the candidate to write a function to validate whether or not a Linked list is palindrome<br>
Help the candidate understand the definition of a Palindrome if he/she is unsure of it.<br>
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of nodes which reads the same backward as forward.<br>
Avoid utilizing any of the built-in methods available in your language.<br>

This problem can be solved using different approaches:<br>
Using a helper data structure (Array or Linked List) to keep track of the nodes.<br>
This method takes O(n) and uses O(n) extra space.<br>
Reversing the Linked List, and checking for equality of the reversed part.<br>
